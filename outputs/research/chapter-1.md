### **Dialogue in Chapter 1**
**The Tension Between Elon and Bezos Over Control**

*Sam, a tough guy, is sitting on the edge of his desk, eyes wide with fear. He leans back, staring at Tesla's car. The engine is cold, its exhaust purring a constant octave.*

**Sam:** (gravelly voice) Why would you want control? Why not let your AI take over?

*Elon, standing in front of him, looks around the room, his face pale. He sees the massive Tesla plant on the horizon and smiles faintly.*

**Elon:** (smiling) It's a win-win for everyone.

*Sam looks up, a mixture of shock and determination. He picks up his phone and presses it into his palm.*

**Sam:** (voice trembling) I don't want control. I want autonomy.
