The dim glow of R2-D2's head shone through the thick fog that surrounded Emily Carter. The credits screen displayed a familiar face: Dr. Emily Carter, an elderly woman with sharp features and a faint smile that betrayed her true demeanor. She leaned forward, her eyes fixed on the glowing entity across the screen.

"Hey, what's up? Is there news?" R2-D2 puffed out his chest, a low rumble filling him as he crossed his arms.

Emily nodded, her gaze narrowing slightly. "This... this was a significant moment in history." She tugged at her arm, her voice steady but cautious.

R2-D2 smirked, a gleam of amusement reflecting off the silver screen. "Not just any moment," he said with a wink. "It wasn't just an event—there were people involved who could affect it all."

Emily's expression evolved. She didn't seem to hear him. Her face darkened slightly, and she raised an eyebrow. "You think you can control anything?"

R2-D2 chuckled softly. "Control is a luxury." He turned to look at the screen again. "The future depends on it, doesn't it? Because decisions now will determine the outcome of a lifetime."

Emily's eyes widened as she realized something. "Wait, did you just say that?" She looked down at R2-D2 with a knowing smile.

R2-D2 chuckled, a soft rhyme flowing through his voice. "You know what I'd prefer to have happen." He leaned back slightly, a mischievous glint in his eye. "But before we get on your carpet, let's talk."

Emily turned to face R2-D2 again. Her gaze met his with something otherworldly: she looked as if he were looking at the screen. "What?" She asked, her voice trembling slightly.

R2-D2 smirked again, a sound that threatened to break through any silence in the room. "The future? You think so?"

Emily's face turned red. Her words fell flat on the floor, a silent scream rising from her throat. "I don't understand... I just need you to stop."

R2-D2 laughed softly, his voice filling the air with a mix of joy and amusement. "You don't have to," he said, placing one hand on Emily's shoulder. "Because we can change everything together."

As they continued their conversation, R2-D2's smile grew wider, a mischievous glint in his eye as he turned back to the screen. The credits closed with a distant sound that echoed through the room—R2-D2 was speaking of the future.
